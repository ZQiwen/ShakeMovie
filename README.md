# ShakeMovie
Create shake movies of seismic waves. 
Written originally for visualizing wavefields computed by the SPECFEM3D_Cartesion package (<https://github.com/geodynamics/specfem3d>). 

## Requirements:
Wavefield data in vtk or vtu format (<https://vtk.org>). 
Python environment with modules pyvista (<https://docs.pyvista.org>) and matplotlib (<https://matplotlib.org>).

## Usage:
Edit Line "MakeShakeMovie('./data/','gif')" and Run the script make_shake_movie.py.

where './data/' is the path to the folder containing your vtk/vtu files

and 'gif' is the format of the output shake movie. Choose between 'mp4' and 'gif'.
